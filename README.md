## Considerations during development

In the project directory, you can run:

## Assumptions

1. Requirements Gathering:

Understand the project requirements and objectives.
Identify the target audience and their needs.

2. Technology Stack Selection:

Choose the appropriate front-end technologies and frameworks based on the project requirements and your team's expertise.

3. Project Setup:

Set up your development environment, including code editors, version control systems (e.g., Git), and package managers (e.g., npm or yarn).

4. User Interface Design:

Create wireframes and mockups to visualize the user interface and user experience (UI/UX).
Ensure a responsive design to cater to various devices and screen sizes.

5.Project Structure:

Organize your project structure with a clear separation of components, styles, and assets.
Use a modular approach for scalability and maintainability.

6. Coding and Implementation:

Write clean and maintainable code following coding standards and best practices.
Use a component-based architecture for building UI elements.
Implement accessibility features for users with disabilities.

7. API Integration:

Interact with back-end APIs to retrieve and update data.
Implement error handling and data validation.

8. State Management (for complex apps):

Use state management libraries like Redux or Mobx to manage app-wide state.
Choose a state management solution that suits the project's complexity.

9. Routing and Navigation:

Implement a navigation system to enable users to move between different parts of the application.

10. Testing:

Write unit tests for components and functions to ensure the application's reliability.
Perform user testing and usability testing to gather feedback and make improvements.

11. Styling and Theming:

Apply consistent styles and maintain a cohesive design throughout the application.
Use CSS preprocessors (e.g., SCSS) or CSS-in-JS solutions for structured styling.
12. Performance Optimization:

Optimize the application for speed and performance by reducing unnecessary rendering and minimizing resource requests.
13. Security:

Implement security best practices, such as input validation and protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) and other vulnerabilities.
14. Internationalization and Localization:

Support multiple languages and regions if your application has a global audience.

15. Cross-Browser and Cross-Platform Compatibility:

Test the application on various web browsers and devices to ensure it works consistently.
16. Documentation:

Create thorough documentation for the application, including how to install, run, and use it.
17. Version Control:

Use a version control system like Git to track changes, collaborate with team members, and maintain a history of code revisions.
18. Deployment:

Deploy the application to a web server or relevant platforms (e.g., app stores for mobile apps).
19. Monitoring and Analytics:

Implement tools for monitoring application performance and tracking user behavior to gain insights for improvements.
20. User Feedback and Iteration:

Collect user feedback and continuously iterate on the application to address issues and enhance features.
21. Maintainability and Scalability:

Plan for long-term maintenance by following coding and architectural best practices.
Consider future scalability needs and adapt your architecture accordingly.

22. Community and Collaboration:

Encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing within your development team.
Be active in the developer community to leverage best practices and stay updated on new technologies.
By following these steps and considerations, you can build a front-end application that not only meets the project requirements but also delivers a great user experience and is maintainable for the long term. Adapt the process to your specific project needs, and always stay current with industry trends and user expectations.

## Bonus Task

## Future Improvements

1. Tailwind CSS
2. Redux for state management
3. Develop a backend node server to handle api call
4. NoSQL database solution e.g. mongoDB
5. More UI iterations and feedback loops
6. Better client side validation

# How to run 

### `npm install`

Install all necessary dev dependencies and package logs before\

### `.env`
API token has to be stored at the root level of the application in a .env file e.g. REACT_APP_API_KEY= *Your api token goes here*

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost: 3000
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
